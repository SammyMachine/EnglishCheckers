    <string name="rules_text">The opponent with the darker pieces moves first. Pieces may only move one diagonal space forward (towards their opponents pieces) in the beginning of the game. Pieces must stay on the dark squares. To capture an opposing piece, "jump" over it by moving two diagonal spaces in the direction of the opposing piece. If you have chosen a checker that you will eat, you will no longer be able to exchange it for another checker, if there is a situation when you can also eat with another checker. </string>
